<h1>Illuminated River</h1>

<p>Fancy seeing a river light up with the light from a thousand fairies? Then come on down to the Thames Bridges in Central London, to see Illuminated River, in hour of the historical architecture </p>
<p>It is the world's largest public art commission, as it is 3.2 miles from London to Lambeth Bridges. Also, it is expected to last for at least a decade, where the fountain will cover all service and energy expenditures</p>
<p>The delicately flowing streaks of LED lights in the river reflect the grandeur of the current architecture of London's bridges and their connection to the river that runs below them.</p>
