<h1>Borealis by Dan Acher</h1>
<hr>

<h3> What is borealis? </h3>
<p> Be amazed by a mesimiring light installation inspired by the Northern Lights, as Borealis lights up the skies over Guildhall Yard in the City of London. Acherâ€™s work uses beams 
of light travelling through particle clouds to create the illusion, mimicking the movement of the natural 
Aurora Borealis phenomenon and matching these visuals with a tranquil soundtrack. </p>
