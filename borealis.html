<h3> What is borealis? </h3>
This unique work from Dan Acher takes over the historic space for 12 nights, having wowed the crowds during London’s Greenwich+Docklands International Festival earlier in 2021.
Become immersed in the free-to-view installation as multicoloured lights cloak and intermingle with the space, mimicking the movement of the natural Aurora Borealis phenomenon.
Grab selfies and photos to wow those back home or simply stop and take in the experience with this spellbinding spectacle in London.
Acher’s work uses beams of light travelling through particle clouds to create the illusion, matching these visuals with a tranquil soundtrack.
